Methods Explanation:
Class Name	Method Name	Explanation	Type
ACHFormat	validate_format()	Validates if the given data complies with NACHA CCD+ or CTX format standards.	Business Logic
generate_ach_record()	Generates an ACH record using the provided payment and remittance details according to the appropriate format.	System Operation
parse_ach_data()	Parses incoming ACH data to extract remittance details and payment information.	System Operation
Transaction	initiate()	Begins the payment transaction process, collecting all relevant data.	Business Logic
validate()	Checks the validity of the transaction data (e.g., amount, remittance details) before processing.	Business Logic
process()	Executes the payment through the appropriate network or system, applying business rules.	System Operation
Employee	provide_payment_details()	Employee submits necessary payment information to the system.	Business Logic
submit_payment()	Employee sends the payment to the SDU via the ACH network.	System Operation
Employer	withhold_wages()	Employer withholds wages based on a state-issued child support order.	Business Logic
submit_to_bank()	Employer submits the withheld wages as a payment instruction to its bank.	System Operation
State	issue_order()	State issues an official child support withholding order to an employer.	Business Logic
notify_employer()	Notifies the employer of the obligation to withhold wages for child support.	Business Logic
verify_payment()	Verifies that the payment has been received and processed by the SDU.	Business Logic
SDU	update_records()	Updates the internal records of child support payments and remittances.	System Operation
credit_account()	Credits the custodial account with the child support payment received.	Business Logic
disburse_payment()	Sends the payment to the custodial parent’s bank account.	System Operation
SDUBank	send_remittance()	Transmits remittance advice to the SDU.	System Operation
process_payment_instructions()	Processes the payment instructions received from the SDU or employer bank.	System Operation
handle_ach_transmission()	Manages the transmission of ACH records to and from the ACH network.	System Operation
Bank	transfer_funds()	Facilitates the transfer of child support funds to the SDU or custodial parent via ACH.	System Operation
validate_ach_entries()	Ensures that the ACH entries meet NACHA compliance before initiating a transfer.	Business Logic
send_ach_records()	Sends the ACH records to the network for processing.	System Operation
ACHNetwork	transmit_payment()	Handles the transmission of payment and remittance data across the network to the SDU or SDU bank.	System Operation
validate_transaction()	Validates that the transaction complies with the necessary standards (ACH, EDI, NACHA).	Business Logic
track_payment()	Tracks the progress of a payment through the network, from initiation to completion.	System Operation
InterstatePayment	coordinate_sdu_transfer()	Ensures correct payment transfer between two SDUs located in different states.	Business Logic
validate_interstate_routing()	Confirms that interstate payments are routed correctly between SDUs and banks.	Business Logic
Workflow	execute()	Executes the defined workflow (a, b, SDU, by_state) depending on the transaction scenario.	Business Logic
track_progress()	Monitors the workflow’s progress to ensure smooth processing and alerts any errors.	System Operation
log_activity()	Logs all activities in the workflow for audit and tracking purposes.	System Operation




Expand Logic: Add more business logic (e.g., error handling, state-specific rules).
Implement ACH Format: Define what the ACH format looks like (e.g., CCD+ or CTX/820) and process it.
Notification System: Use the Employer and State classes to implement notification handling.
Banking Operations: Flesh out how funds move between banks and the SDUs.


Types of Methods:
Business Logic: Handles the rules and decision-making processes of the child support payment system. These include payment validation, issuing orders, and coordinating interstate payments.

System Operations: These methods handle system interactions, such as sending data to the ACH network, parsing files, and tracking payments. They involve lower-level operations necessary for the application to function but are not decision-making points in the business process.

NOTE:
The MVP would likely include core ACH payment processing, account management, basic UI, and state notification workflows
Scope of MVP
The MVP should include:

Basic user interface for payments and account management
ACH payment processing with minimal formats (e.g., CCD+)
SDU workflow handling (at least one state's compliance)
Simple employer notification system
Database integration for payment logs and user data
