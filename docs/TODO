Classes:
- CaseAccount
- SDUBank
- SDUBranch
- EmployerBank
- Employer
- EmployerState
- Employee
- EmployeeBank



Expand Logic: Add more business logic (e.g., error handling, state-specific rules).
Implement ACH Format: Define what the ACH format looks like (e.g., CCD+ or CTX/820) and process it.
Notification System: Use the Employer and State classes to implement notification handling.
Banking Operations: Flesh out how funds move between banks and the SDUs.

NOTE:
The MVP would likely include core ACH payment processing, account management, basic UI, and state notification workflows
Scope of MVP
The MVP should include:

Basic user interface for payments and account management
ACH payment processing with minimal formats (e.g., CCD+)
SDU workflow handling (at least one state's compliance)
Simple employer notification system
Database integration for payment logs and user data
