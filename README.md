# NACHA-Electronic-Application

A project as intermediate to advanced, leaning toward an enterprise-level due to its complexity and scope. 
The inclusion of ACH payment processing, compliance with NACHA standards, interstate payment handling, and SDU banking workflows requires understanding of secure financial transactions and regulatory compliance. Additionally, the project involves multiple entities (employers, employees, banks, and states), which necessitates robust error handling, data validation, and real-time processing.

Implementing this in Python requires strong programming and domain-specific knowledge, especially if this will interact with external APIs or financial systems.
